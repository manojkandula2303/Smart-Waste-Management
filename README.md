Smart Biogas Monitoring & Optimization System
This project is a complete IoT and AI-based solution designed to monitor and optimize biogas production using real-time sensor data and machine learning. It utilizes a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B as the central controller and integrates multiple sensors, a heating coil, and a camera module to manage and analyze the fermentation process within a sealed digester.

System Overview
The system continuously monitors and logs critical parameters affecting biogas yield, including:

Temperature: Measured using a DS18B20 digital sensor.
pH Level: Captured via an analog pH sensor connected through an MCP3008 ADC.
Methane Concentration: Detected using an MQ-4 sensor.
Gas Pressure: Measured through a brass-PVC pipe assembly connected to a pressure gauge.
Feedstock Analysis: Conducted via a small camera module to estimate the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio.
Temperature Control: Managed using a heating coil at the digester base, switched via GPIO.
LoRa Communication: Optional integration of RS-02 LoRa module for wireless data transfer.
All components are installed in a sealed digester with proper air-tight measures (M-seal) and structured wiring through a compact container setup. Gas is channeled through brass and PVC fittings into a motorcycle air tube that serves as the gas storage chamber.

Software Architecture
Operating System: Raspberry Pi OS (Lite).
Programming Language: Python.
API Layer: Flask framework with the following endpoints:
/add_data: Accepts temperature, pH, and methane data.
/get_data: Serves the most recent data for the frontend.
Database: SQLite for lightweight, local data persistence.
Frontend: A simple web dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with real-time data display via asynchronous fetch requests.
Deployment: The application can be hosted locally on the Raspberry Pi or deployed to the cloud using platforms such as Render, Railway, or Heroku for remote monitoring.

AI-Based Optimization (Upcoming Feature)
A machine learning module is under development to enhance the systemâ€™s intelligence. It will:
Predict biogas yield using temperature, pH, methane levels, and feedstock composition.
Provide optimization suggestions such as adjusting heat or feed input.
Analyze camera images to estimate the C/N ratio using computer vision and CNN models.
Continuously improve predictions using historical and simulated training data.

Project Status
Flask backend and web dashboard are fully implemented.
SQLite integration and data logging are complete.
Physical sensor integration and camera setup are in progress.
Machine learning model development and camera-based feed analysis are planned for the next phase.
